NAME
    Acme::Magpie - steals shiny things

SYNOPSIS
     use Acme::Magpie;
     # oh no, some of the shiny methods have gone away

     no Acme::Magpie;
     # phew, they're back now

DISCUSSION
    The Magpie is a bird known for stealing shiny things to build its nest
    from, Acme::Magpie attempts to be a software emulation of this
    behaviour.

    When invoked Acme::Magpie scans the symbol tables of your program and
    stores attractive (shiny) methods in the %Acme::Magpie::Nest hash.

    Shinyness is determined by the return value of the shiny method this can
    be redefined by child classes:

     package Acme::Magpie::l33t;
     use strict;
     use base qw(Acme::Magpie);

     sub shiny {
         ($_) = $_[1] =~ /.*::(.*)/;
         return tr/[0-9]// > tr/[a-z][A-Z]//;;
     }
     1;
     __END__

    This magpie considers identifiers with more numbers than letters as
    shiny. The code is installed with this distribution.

BUGS
    Acme::Magpie will cause most of the code you use it in to die because
    the subroutines it tries to execute just won't be there. This is
    considered a feature.
